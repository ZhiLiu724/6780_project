## R Markdown

load data

```{r}
path = "/Users/zliu/Desktop/2022 Spring/6780/Project/data.csv"
data = data.frame(read.csv(path))
data_with_ct <- data[!is.na(data['census_tract']),]
dim(data); dim(data_with_ct)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
